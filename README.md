# My Machine Learning Library

A collection of ML algorithms I have created over time,
including data engineering functions, plotting and
ensemble algorithms for model validation.

## Roadmap:
-[] data - data engineering folder for use before training 
-[] validation - model validation folder (cross-validation, ensembles, ...)
-[] algorithms folder:
	-[] knn
	-[x] random_forest 
	-[x] k_means
	-[] neural_net
	-[] svm
	-[] gradient_descent
